# PHP SQL Assignment
In this assignment I was practicing PHP native, SQL server statements and functions and web service interaction using cURL.

In order to run the program make sure to follow these steps:
1. Create the database sql_db
2. Change the password in Main.php to your server password
3. Run the server through Main.php
